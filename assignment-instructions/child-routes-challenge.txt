Implement child routing for our recipe route 
example: ...4200/recipes/0 would load the first recipe in the existing list

You'll need a "starting" component that say's 'please select a recipe' 


Inside of "col-md-7", will be your <router-outlet>

    <div class="col-md-7">
      <app-recipe-detail
        *ngIf="selectedRecipe; else infoText"
       [recipe]="selectedRecipe" ></app-recipe-detail>
      <ng-template #infoText>
        <p>Please select an RC car build kit</p>
      </ng-template>
    </div>
